ChatGPT Introduction Project :

Welcome to the ChatGPT Introduction Project! This project focuses on enhancing code quality and efficiency by using ChatGPT for debugging, automation, documentation, and error handling. Through a series of exercises, you'll learn how to integrate artificial intelligence into everyday coding practices.

Implemented by
Sebastien D (Dijon)


Objectives :

Debugging: Understand the practical use of AI in identifying and solving coding errors.
Automation: Learn how to automate mundane and repetitive coding tasks with the assistance of ChatGPT.
Documentation: Use ChatGPT to document code effectively, making it easier to understand and maintain.
Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle invalid inputs and prevent program crashes.
Exercises
